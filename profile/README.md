# Welcome to the Multi-Scale Wave Dynamics Group
Our mission is to deepen the understanding of multi-scale dynamics throughout the entire atmosphere, from the surface to the ionosphere. These scales range from several meters to several thousand kilometers, encompassing a wide variety of phenomena such as gravity waves, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, turbulence, tides, planetary waves, and other dynamic processes that shape the atmospheric system. We seek to make a significant contribution not only to theoretical knowledge but also to real-world applications such as climate prediction, weather forecasting, and environmental monitoring.

## Research Focus
- **Gravity Wave Dynamics**: Generation, propagation, and dissipation of gravity waves, as well as their significant role in driving large-scale atmospheric processes, such as energy transport and momentum deposition.
- **Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities**: How these atmospheric instabilities lead to the formation of waves, turbulence, and both downscale and upscale energy cascades, which influence the broader dynamics of the atmosphere.
- **Multi-scale Wave Interactions**: Interactions between various atmospheric phenomena, including instabilities, turbulence, gravity waves, tides, and planetary waves. Special emphasis is placed on how energy is transferred across different scales, shaping both local and global atmospheric behaviors.


## Tools and Techniques
- **High-Resolution Numerical Models**: We employ both local and global models to simulate atmospheric processes with exceptional precision, enabling the study of fine-scale dynamics and large-scale interactions alike.
- **Machine Learning**: Our research incorporates AI techniques to enhance observational data quality, such as filling in missing data points and improving the spatial and temporal resolution of observations. Additionally, we are using neural networks to approximate solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, improving predictive capabilities for complex atmospheric phenomena.
- **Observational Instruments**: We integrate data from a variety of observational measurments to detect and analyze wave dynamics and instabilities. These include:**Solidum Lidar**, **Meteor Radar**,**Airglow Imagers**,and **Satellite Observations (e.g., AIRS)**, and we also incorporate data from additional ground-based and space-based sources to provide a comprehensive view of atmospheric instabilities and wave interactions.

## Collaborations and Opportunities
We actively foster collaborations with universities, research institutions, and industry partners worldwide. We welcome opportunities for joint research, data sharing, and the development of new technologies.
